The M&ouml;bius strip is the simplest nonorientable surface.  It can be 
parametrised as 
$$ (x,y,z) = (3\cos(\theta) + s\cos(\theta/2), 3\sin(\theta), s\sin(\theta/2)), $$
with $-1 \lt s\lt 1$.  It is not orientable, and is also not closed.

We can build a M&ouml;bius strip by pasting two sides of a square,
following the pattern shown below.

# Knots and Surfaces

This repository contains material for an undergraduate course on knots
and surfaces.  Highlights are the Jones polynomial and the
classification of surfaces up to homeomorphism.

* [Notes](notes/knots_and_surfaces.pdf)
* [Problems and solutions](probs/all_probs.pdf)
* [Three-dimensional diagrams](demo/surfaces).  These use the jsc3d
   library; they should really be redone with a newer framework.
* [Maple worksheets](maple).  These are used to generate many of the
   diagrams.  Diagrams have been removed to reduce the files to
   a reasonable size, but they will be regenerated if you execute the
   worksheets.

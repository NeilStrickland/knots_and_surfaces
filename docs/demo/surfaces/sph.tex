The sphere is the simplest closed surface.  It is given implicitly by 
the equation 
$$ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, $$
and it can be parametrised as
$$ (x,y,z) = (\sin(\phi)\cos(\theta),\sin(\phi)\sin(\theta),\cos(\phi)). $$
The Euler characteristic is two, and the genus is zero.

We can build a a sphere by pasting the sides of a square,
following the pattern shown below.
